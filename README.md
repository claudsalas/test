This project is a single-page, mobile-first landing page tailored for an executive taxi service. It highlights services, fleet information, testimonials, and offers clear calls-to-action that initiate WhatsApp conversations with potential clients.

## Features

- Responsive design optimized for mobile devices and scaling elegantly to desktop.
- Modern visual style with cards, gradients, and subtle depth effects.
- Dedicated call-to-action buttons wired to open WhatsApp chats with a customizable message.
- Built-in language switcher with English, Brazilian Portuguese, and Latin American Spanish copy.
- Organized sections for services, differentiators, fleet, testimonials, booking steps, and contact details.
- Placeholder images that can be replaced easily.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to view the landing page locally.
3. Update the WhatsApp number and default messages in `script.js` to match your contact details.
4. Adjust the localized copy or add new languages by editing the `translations` object in `script.js`.
5. Replace placeholder images by swapping the URLs in `index.html` with your own assets.

The page uses only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to host on any static web service or SaaS platform.
